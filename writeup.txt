We encountered the following error and weren't able to resolve it after inquiring on Piazza:

kodkod.engine.satlab.SATAbortedException: Invalid /Users/.../sat-python/run.sh output: no line specifying the outcome. (line 17, pos 1):
BasicParseError

However, we tried evaluating our SAT solver on large formulas (25 variables, 40 clauses) and found that it solved these instances in under 30 seconds.
